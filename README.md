##Opens rss feed from list
This was created to open updated webcomics with a single click.

I guess you could use it to open the latest entry of any rss feed.
##Usage
Create a new list with comics.py <filename\> --create
Add new rss feeds links with comics.py <filename\> --add <url\>
Change the default website (the one that opens first) with comics.py <filename\> --set_default <url\>
Run the script with comics.py <filename\> to open updated feed pages in your default browser
